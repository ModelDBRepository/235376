for Matlab Simbiology	  

1. LTD_LTP_Model.m

This is the model itself. Running this will build the model in Matlab Simbiology.
However, for standard simulations of the model, it is advised to use RUN_LTD_LTP.m  

2. RUN_LTD_LTP.m     
This code will run a standard LTD or LTP protocol and display some basic plots.
You will be prompted to run either an LTP or LTD protocol.

3. pf_pulse_ltp.m
This is a function to generate the large number of PF stimuli as events in Simbiology

4. cf_pulse.m               
This is a function to generate the large number of CF stimuli as events in Simbiology
