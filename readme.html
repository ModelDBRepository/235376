<li/>LTD_LTP_Model.m

<p>This is the model itself. Running this will build the model in Matlab Simbiology.
However, for standard simulations of the model, it is advised to use RUN_LTD_LTP.m  
</p>
<li/> RUN_LTD_LTP.m     <br/>
This code will run a standard LTD or LTP protocol and display some basic plots.
You will be prompted to run either an LTP or LTD protocol.
<p/>
LTD selection generates (in 5 minutes or so), similar to subplots in figures 3A, 4C in the paper:<p/>

LTP selection generates this image (in 5 minutes or so) calcium traces similar to figure 6F in the paper:<p/>

<li/> pf_pulse_ltp.m<br/>
This is a function to generate the large number of PF stimuli as events in Simbiology
</p>
<li/> cf_pulse.m               <br/>
This is a function to generate the large number of CF stimuli as events in Simbiology
